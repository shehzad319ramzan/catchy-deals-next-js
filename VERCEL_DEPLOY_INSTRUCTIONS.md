# Vercel Deployment - Fix Laravel Build Error

## Current Issue
Vercel is trying to compile Laravel files (`resources/sass/app.scss`) even though this is a Next.js project.

## Immediate Fix

### 1. Vercel Dashboard Settings

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → General**

**Change these settings:**

- ✅ **Framework Preset**: `Next.js`
- ✅ **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- ✅ **Output Directory**: (leave **EMPTY** - don't put `.next`)
- ✅ **Install Command**: `npm install`
- ✅ **Development Command**: `npm run dev`

**Important**: Make sure Output Directory is **EMPTY** for Next.js App Router!

### 2. Clear Build Cache

1. Go to: **Settings → Build & Development Settings**
2. Click **"Clear Build Cache"**
3. Wait for cache to clear

### 3. Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Redeploy"** on latest deployment
3. Select **"Use existing Build Cache"** = **NO** (uncheck it)
4. Click **"Redeploy"**

### 4. Alternative: Force Clean Build

If still having issues, in Vercel Dashboard:
- **Settings** → **Build & Development Settings**
- **Root Directory**: (leave empty or put `/` if Next.js is at root)
- **Ignored Build Step**: Leave empty

## Files Already Updated

✅ `.gitignore` - Laravel directories ignored  
✅ `.vercelignore` - Laravel files ignored during build  
✅ `vercel.json` - Explicit Next.js configuration  

## Expected Build Output

After fix, build logs should show:
```
✓ Creating an optimized production build
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

**NOT** showing:
- ❌ `resources/sass/app.scss`
- ❌ Laravel Mix compilation
- ❌ `public/build/manifest.json`

## If Still Failing

1. **Remove vercel.json temporarily** - Let Vercel auto-detect
2. **Contact Vercel Support** - Might be infrastructure issue
3. **Try different region** - In settings, try different deployment region
